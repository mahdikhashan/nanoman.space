              Hey ğŸ‘‹, I&apos;m Mo Khashan. Frontend Developer on a career change, previously worked for a series-A fintech startup and a swiss web agency. 
              <br/>
              I enjoy building software solutions, communicating with people and contributing to the open-sourse projects.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Interested in Design Systems, I care about user-experience and I love to create highly convertible landing pages.
              <br/>
              In my free time, I create tools for my personal use-cases and share them with the community.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Away from the screen and keyboard, I spend my time on travelling and being outdoor, so far I have visited +20 cities and 3 countries ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ª.
