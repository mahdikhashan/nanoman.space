<h2 className='dark:text-white'>Die Welt!</h2>

Embarking on my first solo travel adventure to Iraq during a university excursion marked the inception of my profound love for exploration. The spiritual aura of Najaf and other religious cities, with their deep-rooted history and the enduring spirit of the people, left an indelible mark, setting the stage for a series of transformative journeys.

Then, I cruised over to Shiraz in Iran – a city dripping with history and the friendliest folks you could meet. Tehran, on the other hand, was a crazy mix of tradition and modern chaos, especially with its wild traffic.

After the hustle of Tehran, I shifted gears and headed to Qeshm and Laft in Hormozgan. Qeshm's laid-back island vibes and Laft's coastal charm were like a breath of fresh air. It's funny how different spots can have their own story to tell. This page is my nod to the thrill of exploring – meeting cool people, diving into cultures, and riding the wave between the known and the unknown. 

Travel, for me, is an ever-evolving journey of self-discovery, a road trip across borders that fuels my soul and widens my horizons.

I've created this page to visualize all the locations I've been so far.
